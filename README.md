# RateAndSort

This is a small tool helping sorting a large set of something by human brain.
Input is a json, containing for example N numbers/things.
Randomly two of the numbers/things are presented to the user who has to decide which has the higher value.
After M runs where M is much larger than N you get a quite fair sorted result.
